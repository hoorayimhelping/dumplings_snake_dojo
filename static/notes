TODO:
- create wallColliding flag
  - if a collision happens against the walls, the game is over
- render GAME OVER text in canvas (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Drawing_text)
- create snake segments
  - handle turning so that the head of the snake turns, but the tail of the snake doesn't turn until it gets to the square where the head does
- tweak directions to be strings ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right') rather than numbers
